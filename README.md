[My Notes](notes.md)

My application will be called Photogenic. It is a multiplayer game based around taking photos. There are multiple game modes that require you to take photos of your friends or objects given to you in a prompt. Every game involves uploading a photo of yourself in order to play. One game is assassins, which involves each player recieving an assigned target. The objective is to take a picture of your target, eliminating them from the game. The other game is a murder mystery wich involves one chosen person trying to take photos of the other participants, while the rest try to finish a scavengerhunt before they are all eliminated.

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

If you need fun free thing to do with your college buddies, look no further. Photogenic is quick way for you and your friends to play imersive games, while out and about. The best part is that you only need your phone! Just upload a picture of yourself and let the fun commence. Sneak around and search for a chance to take a photo of you target in the assassin game, or use your deductive skills to find the traitor in the murder mystery mode. Careful not to get your picture taken! Once someone grabs a good photo of you, the app will let everyone know that you have been eliminated. Fun with friends is now easier than ever.
